## My Coding Journey so far


Learning to code has been quite the challenge so far. I have learned that I don't know how to build anything on my own. I can design websites using CSS and HTML but not JavaScript. I don't really like web design but I am struggling to learn programming. I have no plans to quit coding though. I have to keep working at it because I will figure it out eventually.

I am not blogging about my struggles because I really hate writing. Also, I don't think what I have to say is important enough to share with the world. I am going design this blog with Markdown and use it to share my thoughts.
